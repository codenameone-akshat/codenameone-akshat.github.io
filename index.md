# Introduction

Hi, 

I'm an Engine Programmer with 8+ years of experience in AAA and AA game development, passionate about building high-performance, cross-platform systems.
I have a strong history of taking ownership, working autonomously, and driving features and games from inception to release.
I consider myself a strong team player known for cross-discipline collaboration with artists, design and gameplay teams; who thrives in pragmatic and curious teams, leveraging prior experience as a Technical Artist and Gameplay Programmer to bridge technical requirements with creative goals.

In addition to my programming role, I currently serve as a Technical Lead for the Engine Team in the Central Technology Group of Avalanche Studios Group.
As a manager, I focus on fostering team health and career development through mentorship and continuous feedback loop.
As a technical leader, I provides technical insights to ensure high quality and timely delivery of products.

Apart from my professional side, I love driving cars, playing games regularly, and experimenting with ancient tech like NES.
